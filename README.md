## 3rd Year - 1st Semester Project

### Brief description:

Wattopia is an interactive and engaging platform designed to educate and empower users to optimize their energy consumption. By turning energy savings into an exciting experience, Wattopia encourages users to participate in daily challenges and share their journey toward reducing their carbon footprint, fostering an active and motivated community focused on sustainable change.

The platform offers short, targeted lessons on energy-related topics, such as renewable energy sources, providing users with direct and accessible knowledge. This enables them to make more informed and responsible decisions in their daily lives.

Wattopia also introduces an element of friendly competition through a leaderboard, allowing users to compare their progress with others and earn rewards for completing tasks or lessons, promoting a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

I hope you find it useful!
